## **The God Factory Code of Conduct**  

### **Our Commitment**  
At **The God Factory**, we are committed to fostering a community that is inclusive, respectful, and completely free from all forms of harassment or discrimination. We uphold a strict **zero-tolerance policy for racism** and any behavior that marginalizes or demeans individuals or groups.  

Our community is a space where everyoneâ€”regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, socio-economic status, or any other characteristicâ€”is valued and respected.  

This Code of Conduct is a reflection of our collective responsibility to ensure an environment where creativity and collaboration thrive.

### **Zero Tolerance for Racism**  
**The God Factory** stands firmly against racism in all its forms. This includes:  
- **Racist language, slurs, or stereotypes**â€”explicit or subtle.  
- **Discriminatory behavior or actions** targeting individuals or groups based on race or ethnicity.  
- **Attempts to deflect accountability through plausible deniability**â€”whether by claiming ignorance, intent, or humor.  
- **We acknowledge that social engineering has played a role in shaping systemic biases, but we hold every individual accountable for their actions. Succumbing to these influences is not an excuse. Racist actions, regardless of their origin or intent, will result in immediate and permanent consequences within our community.

**"We understand that intent does not outweigh impact. Actions that harm or marginalize others will be addressed immediately, and plausible deniability will never excuse such behavior. Violations of this policy will result in swift and appropriate consequences, up to and including a permanent ban, to protect the integrity of our community and values.

Remember, Edward Bernays is deadâ€”donâ€™t let him get you in trouble today."**
